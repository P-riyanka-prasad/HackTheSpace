<p style="text-align:center;"><h3>The health system in India has been under tremendous strain for the past year and is likely to continue to stretch to deliver the care needed for rising COVID19 cases, as well as the backlog of non-COVID medical cases. In addition, health workers are responsible for the scaled-up vaccination drives, leading to enormous pressure on their time and capacity. We endorse Government’s target of 5 million daily doses of vaccination and hope to see an immunized population in Indian society.</h3></p>
<p> <br>
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><h3>We find us very proud of if people like our initiative & appreciate our work. It will be best if we are able to connect to the society by reaching more and more people. We hope best our initiative to be popular. Also be user-friendly & affordable for common people, making them aware of hazardous effects of COVID19.</h3></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><h3>Finally, grow by the communities of health system & contribute to the communal growth. </h3><h2 style="color:#00134d"> “THE ANONYMOUS”</h2><h3>wants to be with people for a long time.</h3></p>
